## GagSpeak Overview
Gagspeak is a plugin made to increase the value of your immersion within FFXIV, introducing features such as:
- Configure messages to only work through friends only, party only, or whitelisted players only, or a combination of any.
- Whitelisted tab to add selected players within range to a list, where only people from that list can use commands on you
- Switch between dom or sub modes, to allow for the plugin to be used for the purposes of controlling a submissive one, or being the submissive one.
- Select 3 different layers of gags
- Exchange information between players, which are disguised as RP tells to seem normal in context of use.
- Over 65 gags, wach with their own unique muffle levels.
- Muffle level depends on how much speak is translated.
- /gsm will allow anything after it to be submitted into your current chat channel if enabled, as a muffled speach automatically. (finally, no more "MMMMM!", actual immersion!)
- View the history of your original and muffled messages
- Both client side interaction through the UI, and server side interaction with /gag commands.

# DISCLAIMER
Gagspeak makes use of chat injection, aka detouring and insertting messages directly to the chat using signatures, there are many conditions implemented to maximize the safety of this usage, and there should never be any condition where you will get flagged because i have spent a lot of time making sure there isn't going to be risk. That being said, do not try to brute force an update after a patch if it is marked as out-of-date with a big X until i clear is as up-to-date, so you will know it is safe

### Credits & Thanks:
This is my first plugin, i had to drill myself on this a lot to get it working, and ask for help when i got stuck. So, for those of you who are who you know you are, thank you for helping me every time i got stumped, and putting up with my annoying pokes. Also thank you to Ottermandias for glamourer, as it served for the basis of the plugin structure I commented the fuck out of to learn hjow c# structure works, and plugin structure / format.
