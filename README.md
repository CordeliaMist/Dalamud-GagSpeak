## GagSpeak Overview
Its Finally here, after like 3 months of coding and begging literally everyone I knew for help!

For those who just want to install the plugin:

**Repo Link:** ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CordeliaMist/Dalamud-GagSpeak/main/repo.json```

# Overview
GagSpeak is made with the intent of being more than just a one-sided translator. Gagspeak will allow the user to muffle their speech using a sophisticated garbler algorithm, based on real life gag sound data, to accurately garble speech for each individual gag in their own unique way.

Not only does the plugin do this, but it also implements
- a shit ton of safety precautions and privacy checks
- has encrypted messaging
- whitelist management
- options to give yourself control over other users
- options to restrict others from having access to control you.
- setting a safeword
- setting your mode (dom/sub/mistress/pet/slave)
- define relations with players & view commitment times with one another
- Display a mini profile viewer pop-up windows
- integrated commands for macro automation
- View all nessisary information in the gagspeak debugger
- over 50 types of gags
- equip up to 3 gags at once
- chat garbler will be able to make new garbler messages by combining the garbling properties of each gag equipped together!
- So much more....

I invested way to much time into safety, security, privacy, and features for this plugin, and I'm very happy with how far things have come.

## Notice:
Not all gags were able to get ALL of their data in time, as such, some are incomplete, or have no data. At the moment, the ball gag will give you the most accurate realism, and the others may need some fine tuning.

## For Aspiring plugin Developers:
I struggled a fuck ton learning all this shit. I got laughed at, denied, and talked down on by so many other plugin devs while I tried to make this plugin. I am very thankful for the few who helped me learn how to do plugin development for dalamud and enhance my ability to learn and understand C# better.

Because of this, I don't want to have other programmers suffer the same fate as me. As such, I have HEAVILY COMMENTED everywhere in my code explaining why everything is the place it is, and why things are the way they are. Additionally, I have also provided a plugin overview markdown you can find above this readme on the main page. Where I teach you the fundementals, and how I would recommand looking through the code to get a good understanding of how things work so that hopefully you can eventually make your own! Note I'm not perfect and all knowing, but Im sharing what knowledge I know!

### Credits & Thanks:
This is my first plugin, i had to drill myself on this a lot to get it working, and ask for help when i got stuck. So, for those of you who are who you know you are, thank you for helping me every time i got stumped, and putting up with my annoying pokes. Also thank you to Ottermandias for glamourer, as it served for the basis of the plugin structure I commented the fuck out of to learn hjow c# structure works, and plugin structure / format.
